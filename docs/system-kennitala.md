# System Identification Number (Kerfiskennitala) — Overview

This document describes the System Identification Number (Icelandic: kerfiskennitala), its purpose, eligibility, and application process. A kerfiskennitala is a special identifier used to interact with public systems when a regular kennitala (national ID) is not applicable.

## Scope and Eligibility

- Issued only for individuals who stay in Iceland for less than three months or do not intend to reside in Iceland.
- Registration under this scheme confers no rights (it is not a residency registration nor does it grant civil entitlements).
- Only public authorities may apply for a kerfiskennitala on behalf of foreign nationals.

## Purpose

The kerfiskennitala exists to provide a unique identifier for system-level needs when interacting with the public sector. Typical use cases include:

- Distinguishing individuals in datasets so information can be exchanged reliably between institutions or companies.
- Satisfying legal or regulatory requirements where an identification number is mandatory, even if the person is not a resident and does not have a regular kennitala.

## Application Process

- The relevant public authority submits an electronic application via the Registers Iceland (Þjóðskrá) website to request registration in the kerfiskennitala registry and issuance of a system ID.
- A copy of the applicant’s valid passport or other officially recognized travel document must be attached to the application and be valid at the time of submission.

## Notes for Implementers

- A kerfiskennitala is distinct from a regular kennitala and should be treated as a separate identifier category in systems.
- Do not infer residency, civil status, or rights from the existence of a kerfiskennitala.
